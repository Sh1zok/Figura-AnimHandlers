Have you ever felt like animations and scripted transformations in [Figura](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura) were never designed to work together? If so, this API can help you.
It's allows you to create "situational animation and transformation" handlers.

## Script purpose
This script was created to solve the problem of mixing Blockbench animations, vanilla Minecraft animations, and scripted transformations.
